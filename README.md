### Given a series of tasks with a designated timeframe and a series of tasks without a timeframe, the library will return an optimal schedule to complete such tasks.

#### Todo, currently in very early stages
* Generators to schedule tasks without designated timeframe
  * Different type of generators and must support custom type
* Documentation
* Better tests
